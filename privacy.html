    This privacy policy governs how GCal Default Calendar Setter interacts with your data when you use this extension. 
    <br> <br>
    In summary, this extension needs to access certain user data to function effectively - specifically, it accesses the names and IDs of your Google Calendars, 
    your identification via OAuth 2.0, your local storage settings relating to the extension (to save your default calendar choice & Cmd-X shortcut preference), and the current state of your active browser tabs. 
    This data is used only to provide you with the functionality necessary to select a default Google Calendar and create new events with the default 
    calendar you have chosen in the dropdown menu seamlessly. Your data is not stored on any of my servers, nor do I share it with third parties. All 
    data accessed is retained locally on your device, and is not transmitted outside of the extension. Moreover, while OAuth 2.0 protocol facilitates 
    user authentication, it's crucial to note that this extension does not collect or store your email address during this process. This extension 
    requires access to certain details and browser permissions for functionality:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li> Names and IDs of your Google Calendars -  Used only to populate a dropdown menu within the extension, allowing you to select 
            a default calendar to be selected whenever you use an event creation shortcut from this extension. </li>
            <br>
        <li> 'identity' - This permission is used for user authentication through OAuth 2.0 in order to access the Google Calendar API. 
            This allows you to authorize this extension to make requests to the Google Calendar API on your behalf.  </li>
            <br>
        <li> 'storage' -  This permission is used to store your selected default calendar on your local device. This enables the extension
             to preselect your default calendar every time you create a new event. It also stores your site-wide/browser-wide preference for
             the Cmd-X shortcut  </li>
             <br>
        <li> 'activeTab' and 'tabs' - These permissions are used for this extension to interact with the content of the active web page you are 
             viewing. 'activeTab' is necessary for identifying the hovered over date and whether you are on a Google Calendar Page , while 'tabs' 
             might be used to create or update tabs in response to user actions, such as the creation of a new event.</li>
    </ul>
  
    All of these permissions are required for functional and operational needs, not for collecting, storing, or sharing personal data.
